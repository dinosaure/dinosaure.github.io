    <p>I wanted to make a stop motion movie, but ended up with over 2 minutes of footage filmed on May 11, 2007. Last Sunday I discovered it on a tape. Thinking that I can do something with it, I speed it up 4 times and correct the colors in iMovie &#39;09. All the zooming/blurring effects that you&#39;ll see are made with camera itself. Now I will let you enjoy this short clip:</p>

<p><strong><img src="/images/i-love-you.jpg" alt="I Love You"></strong></p>

<p>I also want to mention that the clip was on Kontain front page for a day and received lots of views. You can watch it on <a href="https://vimeo.com/3911393">Vimeo</a> instead.</p>
