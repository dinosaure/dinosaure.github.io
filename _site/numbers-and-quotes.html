    <p>In this post I wanted to write about numbers and their contributions to user interfaces, mostly on today top web applications. But after some thinking, it just didn&#39;t make sense. Numbers can be interpreted in different ways, depending on user perspective. </p>

<p>For example Kevin Rose thinks that getting <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/25/kevin-rose-10-ways-to-increase-your-twitter-followers/">more followers</a> on Twitter is better, but I tend to disagree. For me is more important to write a tweet that has more value in time, than it has to my followers. What I said is also available for Digg; not the number of diggs matters, but the importance of a news in time. For this, notice what Peter Schiff said about recession in 2006 or 2007.</p>

<p>The question that I want to address to Digg, Google or any other company: how do we measure the relevance of a news story in time? And yes, it sounds like: how do we predict the future with today available tools and technology?</p>

<p>Present is a complex state of mind. You can&#39;t separate it in two, three or one hundred, because it won&#39;t be right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it&#39;s decoration.&quot;
— Jeffrey Zeldman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Design is also a structure or a form. And thinking this way around, it precedes content. It is actually the base that the content stands on; so without it, it won&#39;t be content.</p>

<p><em>After all that being said, he wonders when his blog will hit (Digg) reddit&#39;s front page.</em></p>
