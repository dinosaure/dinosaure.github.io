        </h1>
        <div class="post">
    <p>People on <a href="https://sublevel.net/">Sublevel</a> got pretty upset about me because I decided to make the service available for purchase. I understand the feeling. I understand the betrayal. I understand the fact that Sublevel stands for something unique in a world full of chaos. Sublevel itself is chaos ordered.</p>

<h4>Why</h4>

<p>If tomorrow I will die, Sublevel will die with me. I don’t want that. Do you want that? Does anybody want that? I didn’t build Sublevel for profit, I actually build to get my name on Wikipedia. I didn’t get that yet, still working on it. But the idea is that Sublevel is Sublevel, no matter what.</p>

<p>The moment I decided to sell it, something bad happen in my life. It made me think and think. What do I want more? Sublevel just for me or Sublevel for everyone? Open sourcing it is easy. I make the git repository public. It’s a flip of a switch. But it’s my last option. Selling it to the right team/company is the hard way. I always took the hard way in my life, so I’m not gonna change now.</p>

<h4>Plans</h4>

<p>If messages take off, I will probably remove mentions. You’ll get the same feed using search (recent sorting algorithm). It’s easier to send a message than to write someone’s <a href="https://sublevel.net/username/">@username</a> then hope then other one will answer you publicly. Tech illiterate people don’t even understand how this works. Removing mentions will also streamline the code.</p>

<p>I want to introduce rooms on Sublevel. It will work like messages, but everyone can write on the same #room. As you have noticed, I’ll use hashtags to redirect people to rooms. Creating a room will be tricky — can I do it automatically? Another tricky part — how to perform search on rooms? Yet another tricky part — will it work without mentions support?</p>

<h4>Closing</h4>

<p>I listened to a speech by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_C%C4%83rt%C4%83rescu">Mircea Cartarescu</a> where he discussed his latest book. He talked so well about dimensions (like multiple universes, the multiverse theory) that me realize Sublevel is unidimensional. It’s completely linear. That might be a good thing but also a bad thing. Messages is another dimension. Rooms is another dimension. But all should have the same common purpose: enable people to communicate.</p>
