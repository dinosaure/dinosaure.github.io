    <p>These days I learnt that there&#39;s no such thing as <em>too simple</em>. After years of design work, this is a relieve. I&#39;ve told clients that simple is the way to go, but they always asked for more beautiful complex things.</p>

<h4>The Books</h4>

<p>It all started with me finding about <em>Insanely Simple</em> book of <a href="http://kensegall.com/">Ken Segall</a>. Even if I only read the first chapter, it changed everything for me. I got the idea. The idea was <em>insanely simple</em>. In two days I rethought, not redesigned, both my website and this web service where I&#39;m actually writing on. It&#39;s simply amazing.</p>

<p>But, there&#39;s always a <em>but</em>. Simplicity can be dangerous for text based interfaces. You just can&#39;t splash some text on a site and think you&#39;ve done something wonderful. That&#39;s why we have this thing called typography. There&#39;s a insanely simple book for this too. Matthew Butterickâ€™s <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/">Practical Typography</a> is the body, the head and the legs for those who want to design typographic rich interfaces. Again, I got the idea by reading <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html">typography in the ten minutes</a> introduction that Butterick wrote. I took the whole night, skipped things I already knew and finished the book.</p>

<h4>The Benefits</h4>

<p>The benefits are enormous. I&#39;m more focused on things that actually matter, like focusing on heading text rather than the style of the header. I&#39;ve changed my mind about line height, it can&#39;t be higher than 3<em>/</em>2. It should be slightly lower to keep the readers eyes on the text. Information density increased greatly for both Markdawn and my website. They&#39;re now more suitable for small screen devices. That&#39;s a huge win. It&#39;s the best Christmas gift I could have for myself by myself.</p>

<p>If you find this text boring, there&#39;s a blog I recommend where you can enjoy <a href="http://simply--aesthetic.tumblr.com/">simple aesthetics</a>. Then, maybe, you&#39;ll want to come back to read the books and leave a remark.</p>
