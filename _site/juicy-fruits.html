    <p>I know, I knowâ€¦ I shouldn&#39;t have started this article with such a catchy title. I should have gone with &quot;Fruit Madness&quot;, &quot;This is Sparta, Fruit&quot; or maybe &quot;Return of the Fruit&quot;. But making juice is like listening to the summer hit. I don&#39;t know what this summer hit is, but now I know how to make juice.</p>

<p>Back in February, I was watching a movie where one guy loved his blender more than anything. That was weird and I remember it! And then comes my love for juice, any juice, every juice, only juice. Mixing those two ideas was a natural way to start an addiction.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a rookie when it comes to anything that involves kitchen. Things get better over time, I have to admit this too. My first attempt at making juice was a complete disaster. Two grapefruits  and a bit of cold water were smashed by the blender. The result was something closer to the worst lemonade you can buy from the cheapest restaurant than juice.</p>

<p>After more than a month of trial and failure, it came to this:</p>

<p>My recipe varies by the ingredients that I have. Although the basics are the same. So, here&#39;s a list of the things I recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li>Juicy grapefruits, the big red ones are great.</li>
<li>Any other fruits that you like.</li>
<li>All the fruits have to be peeled. Also, check for seeds.</li>
<li>Honey, but don&#39;t use much. You can add sugar if you want it sweeter.</li>
<li>Cold mineral water with or without lemon. Schweppes can be a life savior in this case.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the blender, any cheap blender from the local store will do the trick. It&#39;s more of a personal taste than anything. I don&#39;t recommend juicy extractors. You lose more than 50% of the content of the fruit by using them, even on citrus fruits.</p>
