    <p>This article is about a man, a machine and a thousand lines of code. Scratch that, it&#39;s about an idea. This is <a href="http://markdawn.com/post/1/" title="Markdown social network">how things begin</a>. You got an idea, you work on it — there&#39;s nothing else. My idea started way back in 2007 when I created a WordPress theme to relieve the pain of bad designed templates people had to deal with.</p>

<p>Basically, all I wanted is for you to write on the web just like you write on a notebook and read what you&#39;ve written just like you read a book. Input should be easy, output should be beautiful. Are you getting it? Easy input, beautiful output.</p>

<p>My marriage with code started in November last year when I joined a local startup. This is how I learned Django, getting up there and working with the best. Then things come from themselves, using Sass, thinking about doing an alternative to Bootstrap, playing with PostgreSQL, design for interaction first, mobile at the core of the product, models, queries, views, templates and all other stuff that comes in and out of a Git repository.</p>

<h4>Fail Before You Start</h4>

<p><a href="http://markdawn.com/">Markdawn</a> will fail before it will even start. I know this very well. Because I&#39;m not the best developer in the world, because nobody wants to use yet another platform, because the name is plain wrong and doesn&#39;t make sense, because very few people know about markdown or even using it to write their documents or articles.</p>

<p>Knowing all this stuff, I still think I should try.  Why? Well, these are the top six features of Markdawn:</p>

<ol>
<li>Easy to read — mobile first experience</li>
<li>Easy to write — fluid interface that adapts to the big screen</li>
<li>Ranking — stories promoted by number of comments</li>
<li>Social networking at the core</li>
<li>Markdown documents storage in the cloud</li>
<li>Designed by one of the best UX designers</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you know why I have written <a href="/archive/stuck-with-writing.html">I&#39;m Stuck with Writing</a>, because I was busy creating Markdawn — a new way to write digitally. I hope this won&#39;t be the last article here, since I&#39;ll continue to write on my <a href="http://markdawn.com/lucianmarin/">Markdawn space</a> from now on.</p>
