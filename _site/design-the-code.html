    <p>Mike Bostock thinks design is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThhbt23SGM">a search problem</a>. He is the creator of D3.js &mdash; a visual JavaScript library for data processing. I watched only the first minute of the video, then it started to get painful.</p>

<p>I did design for the past ten years. I struggled all this time to come up with the best designs and solutions for my clients. Then I noticed that all design patterns are repeating. Eventually, I got bored. Picked up Django web framework and Python programming in 2012 and never looked back. Now I&#39;m starting to understand Cocoa and its relative frameworks while doing a ping-pong game between Objective-C and Swift programming languages. The fact that you can code your ideas and design solutions at the same time is such a relieve.</p>

<p>Design is not hard to do, but it&#39;s hard to master. It takes time, a lot of time. But once you get it then there&#39;s not much else to learn. There are design patterns repeating themselves, just like math formulas and theorems. You find a design solution, then you apply it to all your future works.</p>

<h4>My code. My design. My way.</h4>

<p>Oh, myâ€¦ that&#39;s a lot of me in there. Last year I created <a href="/markdawn/">Markdawn</a> which was a content platform like Medium. It took me two months to code it and I got 150 people to sign up. A lot of time was spent on design. I had to cancel it because people don&#39;t want to waste than 30 seconds with your product without getting some value in return.</p>

<p>In April, I started working on <a href="http://sublevel.net/">Sublevel</a>. It took me three weeks to code it for a public preview. I enjoyed the product experience with a few friends of mine, it felt great. I actually didn&#39;t spend that much time on visual design, because I wanted Sublevel to feel neutral and universal at the same time.</p>

<p>In the last week of May, I started working on <a href="/monochrome/">Monochrome</a>. It took me exactly one week to code it and test it. I even manage to get a planned release day on June 2nd, the WWDC keynote day. The time spent on visual design: none. Instead, I used the system icons provided by OS X and the native UI.</p>

<p>Design is how it works.</p>
