    <p>Before I begin, I want to say that writing isn’t a easy task for me. I’m not a native English speaker and I mostly feel embarrassed every time I think I make a mistake. This happens probably because being a designer, I’m also a perfectionist. Sometimes perfection gets in the way of doing things. So, this piece of text is about how can I solve the perfectionist writing complex.</p>

<p>The only key to move forward is to find solutions. Solutions come when you ask the right question and you get the right answer. Also, getting to write a good article you need three parts: an introduction, the main content part and the final statement. To get the words out of my head, I’m gonna ask a question for each part every time I’m gonna write an article. Simple, straight forward and to the point — these are the ingredients of a good solution.</p>

<p>Just to be clear with you, I’ve begun writing this article asking myself three questions: “Why I’m stuck with writing?”, “Do I have any solutions?” and “What else can I write about?”. What you’re reading now is only the answers. Answers that I had in less time (about an hour) than writing only when I have inspiration.</p>

<p>As you can see, my problem with writing isn’t about not having any good ideas, it’s mostly about how can I get those ideas out of my head and actually, do something meaningful while I still have them. Writing helps me procrastinate less and do more. This way I try to put myself in the shoes of a doer instead of a consumer. Being in a consumer mindset is a totally waste of time and money. After all, I’m not <a href="http://twitter.com/pschiller">Philip Schiller</a> and I don’t want to drive a <a href="http://lucianmarin.tumblr.com/post/28480251724">Bugatti Veyron</a>.</p>
