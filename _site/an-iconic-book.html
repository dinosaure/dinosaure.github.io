    <p>Back in October last year I received an email from Jon Hicks asking me about the <a href="/peculiar/">Peculiar</a> icon project. It was a surreal moment for me, since one of my favorite designers was asking me about a project of mine.</p>

<p>After exchanging one or two emails, I understood that he was actually writing a book about iconography. Later the book was finished under the name <a href="http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/the-icon-handbook">the Icon Handbook</a> and included Peculiar as a reference project for CSS icons. I was pretty anxious waiting for the book to be available for purchase.</p>

<p><strong><img src="/images/icon-handbook.jpg" alt="Peculiar inside the Icon Handbook"></strong></p>

<p>I think I finally made my father proud. He was working more than 30 years with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type">movable type</a> and quite liked the icons from the handbook. He even ask me to translate the interview with me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure any designer will want to have this book on his desk. I, for one, I&#39;m honored to be included in it.</p>
