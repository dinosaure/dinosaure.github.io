    <p>Some people will argue about the grammar difference between “plane” and “plain”, others will accept the title as it is, but very few will notice the creativity, the genius, the magic.</p>

<p>When I was a kid and made paper airplanes I always wondered “will it fly this time around” before I even start making them. I made them anyway, it didn&#39;t matter. Now that I grew up I&#39;m noticing that some things matter and other things aren&#39;t white at all.</p>

<p>Back in the old days I used <a href="/photo/flickr.html">Flickr</a> to expose my thoughts. It was all I need.</p>

<p>Nowdays I need a journal to explain things, a place to share photos and another one to communicate with people that matter. The last thing I mentioned is actually the most important. That&#39;s why I created <a href="http://sublevel.net/">Sublevel</a> — a magical place where all things happen and they happen.</p>
