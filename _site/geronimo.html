    <p>I know I didn&#39;t write for awhile now; well I have been busy with (real) life and other stuff. Yesterday, I received Geronimo!&#39;s latest EP, &quot;A Different Kind of Greatness&quot; from Ben Grigg.</p>

<p><strong><img src="/images/geronimo.jpg" alt="A Different Kind of Greatness"></strong></p>

<p>The album has five tracks: Your New Shadow, Approaching the Skyline, Do the Driving, Black Gate City and Ender. Even if &quot;Aproaching the Skyline&quot; sounds amazing, my favorite song is &quot;Ender&quot;, it fits with my current mood. I should add that they play rock with some indie influences.</p>

<p>Two interesting facts about the band is that they don&#39;t have a bass player and they make and design their own merchandise.</p>

<p><em>After all that being said, he agrees with the guys that there is a special place in (heaven) hell for the creator of auto tune.</em></p>
