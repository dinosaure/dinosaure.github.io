    <p>Sometimes we lack motivation and sometimes we look up for it. Motivation is a process of knowing yourself better. If I have to pick three words that mean everything to me, I’ll pick the ones that will motivate me most.</p>

<p>Picking the words like picking a path is easy. Keeping the same path is the hardest part, almost impossible. But that’s why some of us are born, to make impossible possible. I want to become one of those people. This is my dearest wish.</p>

<p>Simple means simple. You should always get rid of complications because they stay in your way. Direct means having a direction, knowing where you’re going. Lead the way for others to follow. Simplicity is nothing without a good direction. Honest means two things: being true to yourself and being truthful with others.</p>

<p>Why complicate things when you can simplify them? Why chase multiple dreams when you can pick only one? Why be anything else that honest?</p>

<p>Because complicating things helps you simplify them. Because having multiple dreams helps you finding a good one. Because honesty is blissful.</p>
