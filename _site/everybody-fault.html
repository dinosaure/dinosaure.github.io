    <p>What should I write about? The fact that life is stupid or the fact the fact that we make it stupid. Then we come to wonder how did we end up like this.</p>

<p>One particular thing that itches me every time I hear it is the expression &quot;nobody&#39;s fault&quot;. Somebody dies, somebody is sick, somebody close to you is having a problem, somehow you&#39;re staying in the way of someone trying to solve their problems, yet you don&#39;t take any blame. I can go on and list all the things that you can improve in your life or in the life of the people close to you. But who am I? I&#39;m just somebody that takes the blame.</p>

<p>World would be a better place if everyone will just care. Take the blame, take the responsibility, make your life meaningful. Fight for something, lose something, win nothing or more than you imagine — a better life.</p>

<p>A few guys with PhDs in various fields will contradict me saying that I&#39;m wrong because they&#39;re the smart-asses who can see the truth. Who the fuck am I? Just another web designer. Probably not even a good designer, just web «something».</p>

<p><em>After all that being said, he agrees that some people are heartbroken, others are just broken.</em></p>
